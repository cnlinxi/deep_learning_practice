# deep_learning_practice
This is my study & practice repository of some deep learning models which I am interested in.



### Capsule Network

**capsule_net** & **capsule_net_keras**

- refer from [CapsNet-Tensorflow](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow)
- tensorflow implemention of capsule network which come from [[Dynamic Routing Between Capsules]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)

### Transformer
